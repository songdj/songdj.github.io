Before that, I was a research staff member at NEC Labs America in Princeton, NJ, since July 2016. In June 2016, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California San Diego (UCSD) with the guidance of Prof. David A. Meyer. My thesis committee includes Prof. Lawrence Saul, Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos, Prof. Gert Lanckriet, and Prof. Julian McAuley. I also work closely with Prof. Dacheng Tao from the University of Sydney.\nI have broad research interests in machine learning, data mining, deep learning, federated learning, and related applications for time series representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection (with data from IoT devices, healthcare, smart city, environmental science, etc.). I am also interested in graph representation learning with applications to link prediction, node classification, recommendation, dynamic systems, etc.\nRecruiting:  Looking for Ph.D. students to jointly work with Prof. Bing Wang at UCONN CSE! If you are interested in working on machine learning/deep learning/reinforcement learning/federated learning, please send me an email with your CV and transcript.\nCall for Participation: ** 1. ***AI4TS: AI for Time Series Analysis: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications @ IJCAI 2022*** [Link](https://ai4ts.github.io/) 2. ***8th International Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series -- Deep Forecasting: Models, Interpretability, and Applications @ KDD 2022*** [Link](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2022/) + --    News      Nov 2022 I am invited to give a talk about \u0026ldquo;Continual Graph Learning\u0026rdquo; at the CS department of University of Central Florida on November 17th, 2022!
