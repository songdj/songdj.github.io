I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu) (**UConn**). Before that, I was a research staff member at [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com) in Princeton, NJ, since July 2016. In June 2016, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu) (**UCSD**) with the guidance of [Prof. David A. Meyer](https://math.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/david-meyer/). My thesis committee includes [Prof. Lawrence Saul](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~saul/), [Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/~nuno/), [Prof. Gert Lanckriet](http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~gert/), and [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). I also work closely with [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html) from the University of Sydney.

I have broad research interests in **machine learning**, **data mining**, **deep learning**, **time series analysis** (e.g., representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection), **graph representation learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. Recently, I am particular interested in (1) **continual learning on graphs**, with a focus on evolving graphs, dynamic systems, and physical world (e.g., IoT systems, environmental science, etc.) and (2) **federated learning, trustworthy reinforcement learning** with applications to healthcare and biomedical data. Two of my papers [DARNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/ijcai-17-a/ijcai-17-a.pdf) and [HetGNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/kdd-19-a/kdd-19-a.pdf) have been ranked as the **most influential papers** in [IJCAI 2017](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2023-04/) (2nd) and [KDD 2019](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-kdd-papers-2023-04/) (3rd) by paperdigest.org, respectively.
