I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Computing, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu) (**UConn**) since August 2020. Before that, I was a research staff member at [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com) in Princeton, NJ, since July 2016. I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu) (**UCSD**) with the guidance of [Prof. David A. Meyer](https://math.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/david-meyer/) in June 2016. I also work closely with [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02343) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

My research focuses on developing AI and machine learning models in the form of continual learning, graph machine learning, reinforcement learning, LLMs, and foundation models, to perform **time series analysis** (e.g., representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection), **graph representation learning**, and **decision making**, making them more effective, trustworthy, interpretable, and robust for continuously evolving real world applications (e.g., evolving graphs, dynamic systems, physical world, IoT systems, environmental science, healthcare and biomedical data).

Three of my papers [DARNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/ijcai-17-a/ijcai-17-a.pdf), [HetGNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/kdd-19-a/kdd-19-a.pdf), and [MSCRED](https://songdj.github.io/publication/aaai-19/aaai-19.pdf) have been ranked as the **most influential papers** in [IJCAI 2017](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2024-05/), [KDD 2019](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-kdd-papers-2024-05/), and [AAAI 2019](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-aaai-papers-2024-05/) by paperdigest.org, respectively. I received the prestigious **NSF Career Award** in 2024 and **Frontiers of Science Award (FSA)** in the same year.

I have broad research interests in **machine learning**, **data mining**, **deep learning**, **time series analysis** (e.g., representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection), **graph representation learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. Recently, I am particular interested in (1) **continual learning on graphs**, with a focus on evolving graphs, dynamic systems, and physical world (e.g., IoT systems, environmental science, etc.) and (2) **federated learning, trustworthy reinforcement learning** with applications to healthcare and biomedical data. Two of my papers [DARNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/ijcai-17-a/ijcai-17-a.pdf) and [HetGNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/kdd-19-a/kdd-19-a.pdf) have been ranked as the **most influential papers** in [IJCAI 2017](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2023-04/) (2nd) and [KDD 2019](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-kdd-papers-2023-04/) (3rd) by paperdigest.org, respectively. I received the prestigious **NSF Career Award** in 2024 and UConn Research Excellence Program (REP) Award in 2021.
