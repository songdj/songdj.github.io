I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu) (**UConn**) since August 2025. Before that, I was an assistant professor at (**UConn**) since August 2020 and a research staff member at [NEC Labs America](http://www.nec-labs.com) in Princeton, NJ since July 2016. I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu) (**UCSD**) with the guidance of [Prof. David A. Meyer](https://math.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/david-meyer/) in June 2016. I also work closely with [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02343) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

My research focuses on developing foundational AI and machine learning models in the form of continual learning, graph machine learning, domain generalization, LLMs, foundation models, multimodal LLMs, and Agentic AI to perform **time series analysis** (e.g., representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection), understand **complex networks/graphs**, and make **trustworthy and interpretable decisions** for continuously evolving real world applications (e.g., evolving graphs, dynamic systems, physical world, environmental science, healthcare and biomedical data). Four of my papers [DARNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/ijcai-17-a/ijcai-17-a.pdf), [HetGNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/kdd-19-a/kdd-19-a.pdf), [MSCRED](https://songdj.github.io/publication/aaai-19/aaai-19.pdf), and [Empowering TS with LLMs](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0895.pdf) have been ranked as the **most influential papers** in [IJCAI 2017](https://resources.paperdigest.org/2025/09/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2025-09-version/), [KDD 2019](https://resources.paperdigest.org/2025/09/most-influential-kdd-papers-2025-09-version/), [AAAI 2019](https://resources.paperdigest.org/2025/09/most-influential-aaai-papers-2025-09-version/), [IJCAI 2024](https://resources.paperdigest.org/2025/09/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2025-09-version/) by paperdigest.org, respectively.

I received the prestigious **NSF Career Award** (2024), **Frontiers of Science Award (FSA)** (2024), the **UConn AAUP Excellence Award for Research and Creativity - Earlier Career** (2025), the **AI 2000 Most Influential Scholar Award** Honorable Mention - Data Mining (2025), NEC Faculty Research Award (2025), and **Best Paper Award (3rd Place CCC Award)** at BlueSky Track of ICDM 2025. I also received UCONN Research Excellence Program (REP) Award in 2021.

I have broad research interests in **machine learning**, **data mining**, **deep learning**, **time series analysis** (e.g., representation, similarity search, prediction/forecasting, and anomaly detection), **graph representation learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. Recently, I am particular interested in (1) **continual learning on graphs**, with a focus on evolving graphs, dynamic systems, and physical world (e.g., IoT systems, environmental science, etc.) and (2) **federated learning, trustworthy reinforcement learning** with applications to healthcare and biomedical data. Two of my papers [DARNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/ijcai-17-a/ijcai-17-a.pdf) and [HetGNN](https://songdj.github.io/publication/kdd-19-a/kdd-19-a.pdf) have been ranked as the **most influential papers** in [IJCAI 2017](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2023-04/) (2nd) and [KDD 2019](https://www.paperdigest.org/2023/04/most-influential-kdd-papers-2023-04/) (3rd) by paperdigest.org, respectively. I received the prestigious **NSF Career Award** in 2024 and UConn Research Excellence Program (REP) Award in 2021.
